                <h3>MISSION</h3>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to encourage everyone, especially students like us,
                    to use ICT and social media in positive and responsible ways. We
                    want to remind people that the internet is not just for entertainment
                    or trends—it’s also a place where we can inspire, educate, and connect
                    with others. Through our advocacy, we hope to promote kindness, respect,
                    and truth online. We want to influence others to think before they post,
                    to share good content that helps others, and to stand against cyberbullying,
                    fake news, and negativity. Together, we can create a more uplifting and
                    supportive digital community where everyone feels safe and heard.

                <h3>VISION</h3>
                <p>
                    Our vision is to create a world where everyone uses ICT and social media
                    in positive and responsible ways. We imagine a future where the internet
                    is a safe and supportive space for all, where people treat each other with
                    kindness and respect. We see a digital world where students like us are
                    empowered to use technology to learn, grow, and make a difference. In this
                    future, social media is not just about trends or entertainment, but about
                    sharing good ideas, inspiring others, and standing up against negativity.
                    We believe that by promoting positive online behavior, we can help build
                    a more connected and compassionate society where everyone feels valued and heard.

                <h3>GOALS</h3>
                <p>
                    Our goals are to promote positive and responsible use of ICT and social media,
                    especially among students like us. We want to raise awareness about the
                    impact of our online actions and encourage everyone to think before they post.
                    We aim to educate people about the importance of kindness, respect, and truth
                    in the digital world. Through our advocacy, we hope to reduce cyberbullying,
                    misinformation, and negativity online. We also want to inspire others to use
                    technology for good—whether it’s sharing helpful information, supporting
                    important causes, or connecting with others in meaningful ways. Ultimately,
                    our goal is to create a safer, more positive online community where everyone
                    feels empowered to make a difference.

                <h3>OBJECTIVES</h3>
                <p>
                    Our objectives are to promote positive and responsible use of ICT and social media
                    through various activities and initiatives. We plan to organize workshops and seminars
                    to educate students about the impact of their online behavior and the importance of
                    digital citizenship. We aim to create engaging content, such as videos, posters, and
                    social media campaigns, to spread awareness about kindness, respect, and truth online.
                    We also want to collaborate with schools, community organizations, and influencers to
                    amplify our message and reach a wider audience. Additionally, we plan to set up support
                    groups or helplines for those affected by cyberbullying or online negativity. By achieving
                    these objectives, we hope to foster a safer and more positive digital environment for everyone.
