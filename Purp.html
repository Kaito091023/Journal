            <h3>The Purpose of our Advocacy</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The purpose of our advocacy, “Empowering Society Through Responsible Use of ICT and Social Media,” is to guide people—especially the youth—toward becoming responsible, respectful, and aware users of technology. We want to remind everyone that social media and ICT are not just tools for entertainment, but powerful platforms that can shape opinions, influence behavior, and create change. Our advocacy exists to promote mindfulness in the digital world, helping individuals understand the importance of using technology in ways that build trust, spread truth, and encourage kindness.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We believe that by promoting responsible digital behavior, we can reduce the negative effects of the internet such as cyberbullying, misinformation, and online hate. This advocacy gives people the knowledge and awareness they need to use technology safely and positively—turning the online world into a space of learning, respect, and empowerment.
