                    Our advocacy, <strong><i>“Empowering Society Through Responsible Use of ICT and Social Media,”</i></strong> promotes the mindful and ethical use of technology in our daily lives. In today’s digital age, social media and ICT have become powerful tools for communication, education, and self-expression. However, they can also be misused—spreading misinformation, encouraging cyberbullying, or invading people’s privacy. That’s why this advocacy is important: it reminds everyone, especially the youth, that the way we use technology shapes not only our online community but also our real-world relationships and society.

                    Through this campaign, <strong>we aim to educate individuals on how to become responsible netizens who use technology wisely and respectfully</strong>. Being a responsible netizen means <i>thinking before we click, verifying information before sharing, and treating others online with kindness and respect</i>. We also emphasize the importance of protecting personal data, using strong passwords, and avoiding the spread of fake news or harmful content.

                <p>
                    To execute our advocacy, we plan to take practical steps that make a real impact. First, <strong>we will create and share informative posters, videos, and social media posts</strong> that promote digital literacy and positive online habits. Second, <strong>we will organize awareness campaigns</strong> in schools or communities to discuss topics like cyberbullying, privacy, and responsible online communication. Third, <strong>we aim to collaborate with organizations and local groups</strong>, such as the Foundation for Media and Alternatives, to help us spread accurate information and provide digital safety tips. Finally, we will encourage others to <i><strong>take the “Responsible Netizen Pledge”</strong></i>—a personal promise to use ICT for learning, connection, and social good.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By doing these, we hope to build a generation of digitally aware and responsible citizens who understand that every click, post, and comment can make a difference. Together, we can turn technology into a force for unity, respect, and positive change in our society.
